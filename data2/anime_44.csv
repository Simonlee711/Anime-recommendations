A real-life industrial accident that occurred around 12:37 pm on July 10, 1976, in a small chemical manufacturing plant owned by ICMESA where there was a release of 6 tonnes of chemicals from pressure tank, including 1 kg of dioxin. The tanks release sent the chemicals in nearly 7 sq miles. Within days a total of 3,300 animals, mostly poultry and rabbits, were found dead. Thousands of inhabitants in the town were exposed, many suffering from skin lesions and chloracne. The plants company did not notify the public nor the government for over a week that deadly dioxin had been leaked, and it took another week until evacuation occurred. 2 weeks worth of poisoning caused long-term health issues for residents. At the time abortion was illegal in Italy but the government temporary authorized it for the women in fear of severe birth defects.The issues continued to compound when a governing body contracted a company to dispose of the waste barrels. The contractors illegally dumped the waste in northern France and had a notary falsify documents saying that the waste was properly disposed of. This was only discovered thanks to a Swiss intervention.The disaster helped improve industrial safety regulations which were passed in 1982 called the Seveso Directive to prevent future accidents across Europe.The anime follows a group of friends Giulia, Maria, Enrico, Lucio and Angelon during the disaster as they team up with a Japanese journalist Shiro Ando, and begin their own investigation of whats occurring (during the week long period of exposure when the ICMESA refused to notify citizens of the poison).

Shiro continues investigating more and learns of the negligence of La Roche, a company who controls ICMESA.
